# MFPL
An esotric programming language written primarily in python.

This esotric programming language is based of bf(brainf!ck), with '+' as add, '-' as sub, '.' as out, ',' as in, '>' as movr and '<' as movl. The only difference is that loop aren't added yet since this is still in development.

And also, MFPL means My First Programming Language. Still confused why no one used this name.
